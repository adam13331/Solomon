Alex Hormozi inspired this simple conversation chat with himself

The main concept is you and your 85 years old self making a conversation in real life.
You can switch roles between the present and your future self, and you can use for creating a distance from the present and the future to be able to do more conscious decision in the present. You can download the whole conversation into a txt file and use store yourself.

THE APP IS NOT STORE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU! 

App is IN PROGRESS, so any bug can occur
